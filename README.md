# Anomaly Detection in IoT Sensor Data

This project implements machine learning models to detect anomalies in IoT sensor datasets. The models were built using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

## 🔍 Overview
- Preprocessed time-series sensor data
- Trained models like Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM
- Detected outliers to improve system reliability

## 📦 Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## 📁 Files
- `anomaly detection model.ipynb`: Full ML pipeline notebook
